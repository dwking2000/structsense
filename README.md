# 🧩 StructSense

Welcome to `structsense`!

`structsense` is a powerful multi-agent system designed to extract structured information from unstructured data. By orchestrating intelligent agents, it helps you make sense of complex information — hence the name *structsense*.

Whether you're working with scientific texts, documents, or messy data, `structsense` enables you to transform it into meaningful, structured insights.

The `structsense` documentation can be found [here](http://docs.brainkb.org/structsense_overview.html).
